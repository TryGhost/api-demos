# API Demos

At its heart, Ghost is a RESTful JSON API — designed to create, manage and retrieve publication content with ease.

Ghost's API is split by function into two parts: Content and Admin. Each has its own authentication methods, structure and extensive tooling so that common publication usecases are solved with minimal effort. Learn more about the Core API [in our docs](https://ghost.org/docs/concepts/core/).

This GitHub repository contains an ever-growing collections of demos, showing how you can achieve common tasks easily using the APIs, Client Libraries and JavaScript SDK.

Each individual file is a demo, with it's own instructions for how to use it at the top of the file. The .js files are node scripts that will work out of the box when called with your API url and key. The .html files are client-side demos that will run against demo.ghost.io when opened in your browser of choice.
